leiningen2.deb
==============

Debian install pack for Leiningen 2.x, as the current leiningen in debian repositories
is completely outdated.

This package only put the current lein stable script of leiningen repository in the
/usr/bin repository. It is suppressed on installation. For now upgrade doesen't work and
I haven't set a repository up for now.

Installing
==========

sudo dpkg -i leiningen2_2.3.2-1_all.deb

Uninstalling
============

sudo apt-get purge leiningen2
